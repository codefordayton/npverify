# NPVerify
Nonprofit verifier for Dayton Serves

NPVerify is a utility deployed to https://npverify.codefordayton.org/ to support folks checking for nonprofit websites.

NPVerify is a fairly simple [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) application. 

## Getting started

NPVerify is built on Django v4.1 and Python 3.10.

To get started:
* Download Python for your system. For the Mac, I use Homebrew to install it.

* Clone the repository.

* Set up a [virtual environment](https://pythonbasics.org/virtualenv/) in the directory.

* Run `pip install -r requirements`.

* Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the debug server.
